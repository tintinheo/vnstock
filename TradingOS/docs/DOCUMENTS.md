# VN100 Quant Platform — Document Set

All current project documents use **stable filenames**. Internal version history
lives inside each canonical file and in Git history. Do not create versioned
filenames, `LATEST` aliases, or specification ZIP bundles.

## Current specifications and governance

| Document | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`CURRENT_BASELINE.md`](CURRENT_BASELINE.md) | Active architecture/state and canonical document index. |
| [`BRD-VN100-Quant-Platform.md`](BRD-VN100-Quant-Platform.md) | Canonical English business/trading requirements. |
| [`BRD-VN100-Quant-Platform-VI.md`](BRD-VN100-Quant-Platform-VI.md) | Vietnamese business companion. |
| [`SRD-VN100-Quant-Platform.md`](SRD-VN100-Quant-Platform.md) | Canonical software implementation requirements. |
| [`PROVIDER-RESEARCH-REPORT.md`](PROVIDER-RESEARCH-REPORT.md) | Provider research, evidence, gaps, and decisions. |
| [`PROVIDER-VALIDATION.md`](PROVIDER-VALIDATION.md) | Current provider contract, rights, credential, retention, and validation status. |

Current baseline: **`tradingos-governed-providers-v1` — 2026-09-22**. The
maintained package is `src/tradingos`; SSI is retained as a candidate provider.
This index makes no package or test-result claim beyond tracked repository files.

## Historical revisions

The former v3.3/v3.5 BRD and SRD copies, standalone version changelogs and
reports, and duplicate documentation ZIP bundles were compared with the stable
files and removed on 2026-09-14. The canonical documents contain the operative
requirements and summarized internal change history. Exact historical files,
including superseded or later-withdrawn claims, remain available through Git
history; they must not be linked or redistributed as current specifications.

Use `git log --all -- <former-path>` and `git show <commit>:<former-path>` when
an exact historical artifact is required for an audit.
